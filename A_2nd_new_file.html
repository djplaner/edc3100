<p>Welcome. Before you go any further, it might be helpful for you to learn a bit more about <em>Moodle books</em>. i.e. The tool that has been used to implement this resource, and many of the other resources used in EDC3100, including the <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=181&amp;chapterid=845">Assessment information</a>.</p>
<p> In particular, you should know how to:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Find your way around a Moodle book, including how to: 
      <ol type="a">
         <li> Go from page to page. </li>
         <li> Use the table of contents. </li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li> How to print a Moodle book, if required. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you already know how to do all this, please move onto the next page.</p>
<p>If you're unsure, please watch the following short video.</p>

<p>Welcome to EDC3100, ICT and Pedagogy. My name is David Jones and I'm the course examiner for this offering. You can find out a lot more (perhaps more than you need to know) about me on <a href="http://davidtjones.wordpress.com">my blog</a></p>
<p>But enough about me, let's talk about the most important person in this course. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">You!</h3>

In particular, let's talk about who you are, how this impacts your learning in this course, and what you might be at the end of the course.

<h3>Do you care?</h3>

<p>When it comes to what you learn in this course and the grade you get at the end of the course, the most important factor is and should be you.</p>
<p>In particular, the biggest factor is whether you care. Dave Cormier - a Canadian University educator - <a href="http://www.davecormier.com/edblog/2014/12/21/learnings-first-principle-the-most-important-thing-i-learned-this-year/">writes about</a> this being the first principle of learning. It's a perspective I have a lot of time for.  If a learner doesn't care about what they are learning, it's going to be more difficult/unlikely that they will learn.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I have attempted to make it easier for you to care about this course, but I can't make you.  That's your choice.</p>

<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>How much do you care?</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>How much do you care about this course? What about this course do you care about? What are the big questions about ICT and pedagogy that you need answered? What do you want out of the course? What are you going to do in response?</p>
     <p>These are not questions you can answer completely right now. In fact, you will be asked similar questions in the coming weeks. Where possible, we will try respond to your answers to these questions. </p>
    </div>
</div>

</div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="3" data-contentformat="1" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">USQ, personalised learning and your responsibilities</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>Another reason why you are the most important person in this course connects with <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/about-usq/about-us/plans-reports/strategic-plan">USQ's strategic plan</a>. One of the pillars of that plan is personalised learning. That in part is described this way</p><blockquote>Through innovation USQ harnesses emerging technologies to enable collaborative teaching and individualised learning for its students regardless of their location or lifestyle.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly what this means is open to debate. As with much in education the phrase &quot;personalised learning&quot; has many meanings. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_learning">Wikipedia page</a> on personalised learning covers many of them. The definition that I like and have tried to achieve in the design of this course is from the National Educational Technology Plan from the US Department of Education, which is described on Wikipedia as </p><blockquote>personalized learning is defined as adjusting the pace (individualization), adjusting the approach (differentiation), and connecting to the learner's interests and experiences. Personalization is broader than just individualization or differentiation in that it affords the learner a degree of choice about what is learned, when it is learned and how it is learned. The rhetoric is often phrased in terms of learning 'any time, any where or any place'. This may not indicate unlimited choice, since learners will still have targets to be met. However, it may provide learners the opportunity to learn in ways that suit their individual learning styles and multiple intelligences.</blockquote>

<h3>What does this mean?</h3>

<p>In this course, this doesn't mean that everything about the course has been personalised for every single learner. Instead it means that the course has been designed to give you the flexibility to choose where, when and what you will focus your learning on. The role of the teaching staff will be to help provide that flexibility. If you find the course inflexible, let us know.</p>

<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>What is your focus? What do you want to learn?</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p>Again these are not questions you can give a final answer to. Instead, these are questions you should start pondering and continue returning to as you progress through the course. </p>
   </div>
</div>

<h3>Your responsibilities</h3>

<p>This implies that you are taking on some responsibility for what and how you will learn. After all, you are hopefully the person most aware of what you want to learn and how best you can learn it.</p>
<p>Your responsibilities don't stop there.  USQ has a <a href="http://policy.usq.edu.au/documents.php?id=13446PL">&quot;Student expectations and responsibilities policy&quot;</a>.</p>

<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Check out the expectations and responsibilities</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
        <p>Now's a good time to be sure that you are fully aware of the expectations and responsibilities.</p>
   </div>
</div>

</div><div class="mg-book_chapter"  data-subchapter="0" data-pagenum="4" data-contentformat="1" data-hidden="0"><h1 class="mg-chapterTitle">Who might you be</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />

<p>You may have noticed on the previous page that the term &quot;teacher&quot; was being used to describe you. Formally, this is not correct. i.e. you are almost certainly not yet a formally accredited teacher as defined by the official folk. However, as this is typically a 3rd year course for most students, you are not that far away. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why this course is designed based on the assumption that you are a teacher.</p>
<p>The practices and knowledge you gain in this course are designed to help you operate as a teacher. Both in the Professional Experience you will be completing at the end of the semester, and in your subsequent teaching career.</p>


<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Does thinking of you as a teacher change how you study?</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
    <p>Do you think of yourself as a teacher yet? What about when you are on Professional Experience?</p>
    <p>If you think of yourself as a teacher - rather than as a University student - how might this change how you study this course?</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Sherman and Kurshan (2004) claim that </p><blockquote>learning begins with learners' existing conceptions, growth comes from changing and expanding their existing beliefs' (p. 10).</blockquote>This is an understanding of learning that we will revisit in later weeks.
<p>You will be asked to think seriously about your existing conceptions about Information and Communication Technologies (ICT aka digital technologies) and the value they can provide for learning and teaching.  You will also be asked to engage in a series of activities that encourage you to change and expand those beliefs.</p>
<p>You will be asked to reflect on what you have seen and done around ICT and pedagogy and use a variety of frameworks to evaluate, critique and improve.</p>

<div class="dj_task"> 
   <div class="dj_task_title"><p>Conceptions of ICT and Pedagogy?</p></div>  
   <div class="dj_activity">
     <p> What are your conceptions of ICT and Pedagogy? Why do you hold those conceptions? Should they change (or not)? How might they change? </p>
       <p>These are perhaps the main questions to keep in mind throughout the rest of the course. You should always be asking yourself these questions in light of what you read, listen to, talk about, and do in the course.</p>

<p>Are you a digital native? Or are you a digital immigrant?</p>
<p>This distinction is sometimes understood as anyone born before 1970 is a digital immigrant. i.e. they don't really understand digital technologies. If you didn't grow up with it you can never really get it.</p>
<p>This is a silly question.  The concept of digital natives and immigrants is completely and utterly unhelpful and it is also not true. </p>

<p>Some evidence for this statement includes:</p>
<ol>
  <li> my example;
       <p>I was born before 1970. A few years ago I had to explain to my teenage daughter why she was such a loser for being on MySpace and that Facebook was actually the place to be. I build software and web applications. ICT is firmly embedded in my pedagogy. I am not a digital immigrant simply because of my age.</p> <p>In the last couple of days I've had to help out my 8 and 10 year old sons with various aspects of their computer use. They've grown up in a house with access to a lot of ICT. They do not inherently know how to use ICTs.</p></li>
  <li> the literature; and,
       <p>Bennett et al (2008) analyse the digital native literature and the evidence on which it is based.  They conclude</p><blockquote>The picture beginning to emerge from research on young people’s relationships with technology is much more complex than the digital native characterisation suggests.  While technology is embedded in their lives, young people’s use and skills are not uniform. There is no evidence of widespread and universal disaffection, or of a distinctly different learning style the like of which has never been seen before. We may live in a highly technologised world, but it is conceivable that it has become so through evolution, rather than revolution. Young people may do things differently, but there are no grounds to consider them alien to us. Education may be under challenge to change, but it is not clear that it is being rejected. (p. 783)</blockquote></li>
  <li> the originator's perspective.
        <p>The apparent originator of these terms explains on <a href="http://marcprensky.com/digital-native/">his personal website</a> that this understanding of his argument is mistaken.</p>
   </li>
</ol>

<p>Based on past experience, there's a good chance that you think you and technology don't get along. It's not something you're comfortable with. Especially not when you're trying to teach a class. You might even be scared of technology.</p>
<p>There are almost certainly going to be times during this course when you get really, really frustrated with technology. You may even think that you'll never get it.</p>
<p>Between the work of Carol Dweck on fixed versus growth mindsets (watch the video below or check out <a href="http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/">this blog post</a> that does a good job of summarising her work) and work on <a href="http://www.noprobo.com/posts/brain-plasticity-you-can-teach-an-old-dog-new-tricks">brain plasticity</a> the old adage that you can't teach an old dog new tricks is false.  Old dogs can learn new tricks, and the learning of new tricks is good for them. </p>
<p>i.e. you can learn how to effectively use ICT to enhance and transform your pedagogy.</p>
<p>It just takes time, effort and a bit of encouragement. If you're having problems, don't think you can't, just think &quot;not yet&quot; (the video below will explain &quot;not yet&quot;)</p>

<p>By the end of this semester, you will probably be going on Professional Experience and will be expected to use ICT to enhance and transform your teaching. It's also likely that the quality and quantity of ICT available to you in your classroom will remind you of the classroom to the right. The technology you have available will be limited, probably won't work very well, and may well require a fair bit of effort to get something effective done.</p>
<p>This is a challenge that many folk in EDC3100 will face when they go on PE. It's often their biggest concern when they go on PE.  Will the ICT be good enough to use?</p>
<p>Even though USQ typically provides a much greater level of ICT, it's a problem that I face teaching EDC3100. I've even started using the term <a href="https://davidtjones.wordpress.com/2014/12/18/concrete-lounge/">&quot;concrete lounge&quot;</a> to describe the feeling I get when using some of the USQ technologies.</p>

<h3>You as a digital renovator</h3>

<p>This is where the idea of you as a <a href="http://fedwiki.djon.es/view/welcome-visitors/view/digital-renovator">digital renovator</a> enters the picture.</p>
<p>No-one would be silly enough to just live with a concrete lounge. Instead they would seek to change it, to renovate. If you were faced with a concrete lounge, at the very least you would be looking for some pillows or cushions. You might even engage in more radical renovations.</p>
<p>The digital environment is not meant to be a concrete lounge. Digital technologies can be manipulated and renovated. We'll pick up on this again in week 1.</p>
<p>My hope is that as we progress through the course you will begin to think of yourself as a digital renovator.</p>
