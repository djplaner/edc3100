<p>As you should know, this course includes an embedded Professional Experience (PE). You cannot pass this course, without passing your Professional Experience (PE). <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=181&amp;chapterid=851">Assignment 3</a> is designed to help you prepare, implement, and reflect on your Professional Experience.</p>
<p>It is time that you make sure that you are prepared for Professional Experience. </p>
<p>If you are repeating this course within 12 months of your last attempt, you do not have to go on Professional Experience. Please ignore the following and <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=55&amp;chapterid=326">read this</a>.</p>

<h3>What you have to do - NOW</h3>

<p>Really, you should be doing the following steps <strong>NOW</strong> or at least really, really, soon.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=55&amp;chapterid=324">Check that your Blue Card</a> (or equivalent) is current. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=55&amp;chapterid=321">Check the dates</a> for Professional Experience. </li>
  <li> <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=55&amp;chapterid=325">Submit a placement form</a> to your nearest PE office. </li>
</ol>

</div><div class="book_chapter"  date-subchapter="0" date-pagenum="2" date-contentformat="1" date-hidden="0"><h1 class="chapterTitle">Check your Blue Card (or equivalent)</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>Do you have a Blue Card (or equivalent)?</p>
<ol>
  <li> No.
      <p>Then <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/blue-card">follow the directions on this page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> Yes.
     <p>Then check the expiry date. Is your Blue Card (or equivalent) still valid until a couple of months after your PE finishes?</p>
     <ol type="a">
        <li> Yes.
        <p>Then <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/blue-card">follow the directions on this page</a>.</p> </li>
        <li> No.
         <p>All good, you've completed this step.</p>
        </li>
     </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

</div><div class="book_chapter"  date-subchapter="0" date-pagenum="3" date-contentformat="1" date-hidden="0"><h1 class="chapterTitle">Check the dates for PE</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>Check the <a href="http://localhost:8080/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=182">Study Schedule</a> to see when you are due to go on Professional Experience.</p>
<p>Are you available for these dates? Can all your family, work, and other commitments be organised so you can be on Professional Experience (full-time) during this time?</p>
<ol>
  <li> Yes.
     <p>Then you're all good for this step.</p>
  </li>
  <li> No.
     <p>Then you need to explore some options. See below.</p> 
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>What if you can't make these dates?</h3>

<p>If you can't make these dates, then your options are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Apply for a variation in dates.
      <p>Such an application will need to be made to <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/contact-us">the Professional Experience office</a>. The approval process does required final approval from the Course Examiner.</p> <p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> Be sure you first read the section on variations below.</p> </li>
  <li> Drop the course.
       <p>Seriously, you can't pass the course without completing Professional Experience.</p> </li>
</ol>

</div><div class="book_chapter"  date-subchapter="1" date-pagenum="4" date-contentformat="1" date-hidden="0"><h1 class="chapterTitle">PE date variations</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>In EDC3100, the only variations to PE dates that are allowed are either starting:</p>
<ol>
  <li> no more than a week before the normal dates; or, </li>
  <li> after the normal dates.</li>
</ol> 
<p><strong>You will almost certainly NOT be allowed to start your Professional Experience early.</strong></p>
<p>This is because you will need to integrate ICTs into your teaching on Professional Experience and the learning paths in Module 3 prepare you for this task. In addition, assignment 2 is due only a few weeks before hand. This means that it is unlikely that you will have engaged in the Module 3 learning paths effectively before going on PE.</p>
<p>
Given that the explicit aim of your Professional Experience is to integrate the use of ICTs into your pedagogy, not completing the Module 3 learning paths is a serious issue. Hence early starts are usually not approved.</p>

<p><strong>There is some significant flexibility around starting PE later.</strong> A later start on PE, also means that you will get an extension on Assignment 3 (including the learning journal).</p>

</div><div class="book_chapter"  date-subchapter="0" date-pagenum="5" date-contentformat="1" date-hidden="0"><h1 class="chapterTitle">Submit a placement form</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>You must submit a placement form (all the PE forms are available from <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/forms">this page</a>)for your Professional Experience. Which form you submit depends on your situation. If you are:</p>
<ol>
  <li> a BVET student - then submit Form V; </li>
  <li> not a Queensland student - then submit Form A; </li>
  <li> returning to a prior placement - then submit Form A; 
       <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> See the explanation about return placements below.</p>  </li>
  <li> Queensland student (not returning to a prior placement) - the submit Form R. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Return placements</h3>

<p>Some students in EDC3100 will be returning to a site they had attended on a previous PE. There may well be exceptions depending on your personal situation. If you have any queries, please contact the Professional Experience office.</p>
<p>The following summarises which students are returning to a prior placement.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Early Childhood: Primary school (Prep â€“Yr 3).
       <p>Returning to the prior site from EDE2010</p> </li>
  <li> Special Education: Special Ed setting. 
       <p>Returning to prior site from SPE3001. </p> </li>
</ul>

</div><div class="book_chapter"  date-subchapter="0" date-pagenum="6" date-contentformat="0" date-hidden="0"><h1 class="chapterTitle">Are you exempt from PE?</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 
<p>Please ignore this page if you will be going on PE for EDC3100.</p>
<p>If you are repeating this course within 12 months of failing it and you have previously passed the Professional Experience component, then you may not need to go on Professional Experience this semester.</p>
<p>If you are in this situation, then:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Please contact <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au/current-students/assessment/professional-experience/contact-us">the Professional Experience office</a> ASAP to confirm that you are exempt. </li>
  <li> If exempt, please inform <a href="{{{CE_LINK}}}">the Course Examiner</a> - <span class="dj_value">CE_NAME. </span></li>
</ol>

<p> Assignment 3 is based around Professional Experience, if you are exempt you aren't going on PE, so what do you do?  The learning paths from Module 3 will explain what you will need to do about Assignment 3. </p></div><div class="book_chapter"  date-subchapter="0" date-pagenum="7" date-contentformat="1" date-hidden="0"><h1 class="chapterTitle">Conclusions</h1><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/styles.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDC3100/dj_macro.js"></script> 



<p>If you are going on Professional Experience, then by the end of week 2 of semester (between <span class="dj_value">{{{W2_PERIOD}}}</span>) you must have submitted a form to the PE office.</p>
<p>If you aren't going on PE, then you should have notified the Course Examiner and the PE Office that you are exempt from PE.</p>
